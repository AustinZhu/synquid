- CEGIS solver (what to do with multiple solutions? do we need a lattice over them?)
- Unit tests
- Try more examples
- Constraint generator
- Try smten
- Parametrize with: choice of next solution to be strengthened (e.g. should we sort solutions according to the # of constraints they satisfy?)
