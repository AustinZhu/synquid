- make TypeSkeleton a functor?
- For function constants: make qspace dependent on solution for other unknowns when it's been chosen
- Optimiztions
	If u's qspace has a single qualifier: put it directly into the solution
	If u appears as a head of exactly one clause, it can be replaced by its body and the clause can be thrown away (provided they have the same variables?) 
	If u's qspace is empty there's no solution to the whole thing
- Explicit search
- Recursion
- Try smten

- Look at bad example for CEGIS: y >= x && x = i ==> y >= 5. Better when known lhs is stronger (y == x) or unknown lhs is weaker (x >= i) -> think about this
- Second solver for CEGIS
- Do we need multiple solutions for parameters? Do we need a lattice over them?
- Use optimization instead of UNSAT cores in CEGIS?
