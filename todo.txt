- New solver based on weakening
- Try smten

- Look at bad example for CEGIS: y >= x && x = i ==> y >= 5. Better when known lhs is stronger (y == x) or unknown lhs is weaker (x >= i) -> think about this
- One point propagation
- Second solver for CEGIS
- Do we need multiple solutions for parameters? Do we need a lattice over them?
- Use optimization instead of UNSAT cores in CEGIS?
