- Do we need strongest counterexamples / weakest solutions (or the other way around) for weak RHSs? Read PLDI paper.
- Do we need multiple solutions for parameters? Do we need a lattice over them?
- How to generalize to arbitrary constraints with arbitrary # inputs? Start with all independent and classical CEGIS and then pick dependent variables 
- Refactor
- Unit tests
- Try more examples
- Constraint generator
- Try smten
- Parametrize with: choice of next solution to be strengthened (e.g. should we sort solutions according to the # of constraints they satisfy?)
