- WellFormedSymbol constraints: adapt search space for scalars (only variable/constant types?), check functions in empty environment
- Preconditions/lower bound filtering: disjunctive lower bound as a constraint type. One way to integrate:
	- one in a while check (post => t) constraint and filter out infeasible lower bounds for a solution
	- if all lower bounds are filtered out, the solution is infeasible
	- when the solution is otherwise valid or only few lower bounds are left, split into unique lower bounds and strengthen preconditions
- Marco: two solvers, bells and whistles from the paper/python implementation
- Termination


- Polymorphism
- Parser for types and templates
- make TypeSkeleton a functor?
- Explicit search

- Look at bad example for CEGIS: y >= x && x = i ==> y >= 5. Better when known lhs is stronger (y == x) or unknown lhs is weaker (x >= i) -> think about this
- Second solver for CEGIS
- Do we need multiple solutions for parameters? Do we need a lattice over them?
- Use optimization instead of UNSAT cores in CEGIS?
