- Constraint generator
- Apriori splittability analysis should take var and const into account better

- Look at bad example for CEGIS: y >= x && x = i ==> y >= 5. Better when known lhs is stronger (y == x) or unknown lhs is weaker (x >= i) -> think about this
- One point propagation
- Second solver for CEGIS
- Do we need strongest counterexamples / weakest solutions (or the other way around) for weak RHSs? Read PLDI paper.
- Do we need multiple solutions for parameters? Do we need a lattice over them?
- How to generalize to arbitrary constraints with arbitrary # inputs? Start with all independent and classical CEGIS and then pick dependent variables
