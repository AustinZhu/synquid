- Case
- Recursion on lists
- Polymorphism
- Higher-order functions
- Abstract refinements
- Explicit search
- Other Data types

- Disjunctive constraints vs. indexed/disjunctive types vs. abstracting leaf types with smart constraint manipulation (just not all at once!)
- Block infeasible combinations of symbol qualifiers right away; can we achieve more with search space manipulation?
- Do not treat neg assumptions as RHS (this enables vacuous branches!)

- Evaluation of disjunctive constraints: keep track of valid/invalid for each conjunct
